# NYPD-Data-Analysis
Included is a are two notebooks. The first one details my exploratory data analysis of the NYPD data set. The second details our process of diving into the data set, hoping to answer a specific research question. The second notebook also contains an implementation of a decision tree classifier model in order to identify trends in the data and predict whether a complaintant is going to get a successful outcome from their allegation.
